#  Search Page

## Search Page Functionality

### The search page now dumps its results into a UITableView that displays each of the
movies found by the search in a row. The row displays the poster image, the title of the
movie and the overview text. The rows are not all the same size but are dynamically sized 
to accommodate the amount of text found in the movie's overview. 

The row also includes a favourite icon ( in the shape of a heart ) that can be tapped on,
the app remembers which movies have been favourited between searches and once a movie has been
favourited it will be remembered as such as till as such time as the app is refreshed.
